I have a Dlink DWA-182 USB Wi-Fi adapter that requires a separately built driver. The official one doesn't support Kernel version 5, so I have been using this third party one (https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2BU_WiFi_linux_v5.3.1_27678.20180430_COEX20180427-5959) on Ubuntu. However, I am trying to switch to OpenSUSE, where the driver build process doesn't seem to work. I am using these commands as listed in the repository documentation: git clone https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2BU_WiFi_. Yesterday I was learning about networks and ip addresses and I found my network configuration page and I could see the who is connecting to my wi-fi through the logs. I can see their private ip address, mac address and name of device. How can I get more info if I know only that info about the device, can I track down the location of the device. I paid for 10mbps internet, I've only getting 0.4-1mbps. Do you know guys how to solve it? Thanks for advance. 
She had a friend. That she worked with. This friend, we will call Stacy, because my family is on reddit and some of them know some of this story. My wife and Stacy were best friends. They did a lot together and talked on the phone every day, sometimes multiple times a day. I used to joke that my wife had a crush on her. So always got super defensive about that. I went to their house and hung out with Stacy and her husband. A little foreshadowing. I got along fine with her husband, but I always. I managed to get A windows 7 gaming PC working again after a painfully long time. Recently however, My Wi-Fi has gone on it, My dongle is no longer reacting to me removing it and putting it back in, I've reinstalled the drivers and still nothing happened. The dongle I use is an Archer TU2 (which I know TP link dongles tend to die alot so it could be the case that the dongle has died). Is my dongle dead or is there I have an iPhone and an iPad and typically the Internet connection is solid but once in a while the Internet connection just stops responding and I have to turn on airplane mode and then turn it off so that they leave the Wi-Fi network and re-join and then after they re-join the online connection works again. I‚Äôm just not sure why this keeps happening randomly any thoughts. Starting from today, no matter what happens, when I try to play Dragalia on my phone, I keep getting the error code 160. Can someone please help me on stopping it from appearing.
